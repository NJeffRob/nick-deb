# nick-deb
My version of debian for the install that I want. The init.lua file is for neovim quickstarting. For more info, visit: https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim

Note that you will need a stable install of debian without a desktop environment but with system utilities installed.

To Install:
* git clone https://github.com/NJeffRob/nick-deb
* cd nick-deb
* sudo ./install.sh
